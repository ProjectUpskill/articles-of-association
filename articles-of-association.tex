    \section{Powers}
    \item The charity has power to do anything which is calculated to further
    its Object(s) or is conducive or incidental to doing so. In particular, the
    charity has power:
    
    \begin{enumerate}[label=(\arabic*)]
        \item to raise funds. In doing so, the charity must not undertake any
        taxable permanent trading activity and must comply with any
        relevant statutory regulations;
        
        \item to buy, take on lease or in exchange, hire or otherwise acquire
        any property and to maintain and equip it for use;
        \item to sell, lease or otherwise dispose of all or any part of the
        property belonging to the charity. In exercising this power, the
        charity must comply as appropriate with sections 117 and 122
        of the Charities Act 2011.
        \item to borrow money and to charge the whole or any part of the
        property belonging to the charity as security for repayment of
        the money borrowed or as security for a grant or the discharge
        of an obligation. The charity must comply as appropriate with
        sections 124 - 126 of the Charities Act 2011 if it wishes to
        mortgage land;
        \item to co-operate with other charities, voluntary bodies and
        statutory authorities and to exchange information and advice
        with them;
        \item to establish or support any charitable trusts, associations or
        institutions formed for any of the charitable purposes included
        in the Objects;
        \item to acquire, merge with or to enter into any partnership or joint
        venture arrangement with any other charity;
        \item to set aside income as a reserve against future expenditure but
        only in accordance with a written policy about reserves;
        \item to employ and remunerate such staff as are necessary for
        carrying out the work of the charity. The charity may employ
        or remunerate a director only to the extent it is permitted to do
        so by article 7 and provided it complies with the conditions in
        that article;
        \item to:
        \begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
            \item deposit or invest funds;
            \item employ a professional fund-manager; and
            \item arrange for the investments or other property of the
            charity to be held in the name of a nominee;
            in the same manner and subject to the same conditions as the
            trustees of a trust are permitted to do by the Trustee Act 2000;
        \end{enumerate}
        \item to provide indemnity insurance for the directors in accordance
        with, and subject to the conditions in, section 189 of the
        Charities Act 2011;
        \item to pay out of the funds of the charity the costs of forming and
        registering the charity both as a company and as a charity.
    \end{enumerate}
    
    \section{Application of income and property}
    \item \begin{enumerate}[label=(\arabic*)]
        \item The income and property of the charity shall be applied solely
        towards the promotion of the Objects.
        \item \begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
            \item A director is entitled to be reimbursed from the property
            of the charity or may pay out of such property reasonable
            expenses properly incurred by him or her when acting on
            behalf of the charity.
            \item A director may benefit from trustee indemnity insurance
            cover purchased at the charity's expense in accordance
            with, and subject to the conditions in, section 189 of the
            Charities Act 2011.
            \item A director may receive an indemnity from the charity in
            the circumstances specified in article 57.
            \item A director may not receive any other benefit or payment
            unless it is authorised by article 7
        \end{enumerate}
        \item Subject to article 7, none of the income or property of the
        charity may be paid or transferred directly or indirectly by way
        of dividend bonus or otherwise by way of profit to any member
        of the charity. This does not prevent a member who is not also a
        director receiving:
        \begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
            \item a benefit from the charity in the capacity of a beneficiary
            of the charity;
            \item reasonable and proper remuneration for any goods or
            services supplied to the charity
        \end{enumerate}
    \end{enumerate}
    
    \section{Benefits and payments to charity directors and connected persons}
    \item \begin{enumerate}[label=(\arabic*)]
        \subsection{General provisions}
        
        \item No director or connected person may:
        \begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
            \item buy any goods or services from the charity on terms
            preferential to those applicable to members of the public;
            \item sell goods, services, or any interest in land to the charity;
            \item be employed by, or receive any remuneration from,
            the charity;
            \item receive any other financial benefit from the charity;
        \end{enumerate}
        
        unless the payment is permitted by sub-clause (2) of this article,
        or authorised by the court or the prior written consent of the
        Charity Commission has been obtained.
        
        In this article a `financial benefit' means a benefit, direct or indirect,
        which is either money or has a monetary value.
        
        \subsection{Scope and powers permitting directors' or connected persons' benefits}
        \item \begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
            \item A director or connected person may receive a benefit from
            the charity in the capacity of a beneficiary of the charity
            provided that a majority of the directors do not benefit in
            this way.
            \item A director or connected person may enter into a contract
            for the supply of services, or of goods that are supplied in
            connection with the provision of services, to the charity
            where that is permitted in accordance with, and subject
            to the conditions in, sections 185 and 186 of the Charities
            Act 2011.
            \item Subject to sub-clause (3) of this article a director or
            connected person may provide the charity with goods
            that are not supplied in connection with services provided
            to the charity by the director or connected person.
            \item A director or connected person may receive interest on
            money lent to the charity at a reasonable and proper rate
            which must be not more than the Bank of England bank
            rate (also known as the base rate).
            \item A director or connected person may receive rent for
            premises let by the director or connected person to the
            charity. The amount of the rent and the other terms of
            the lease must be reasonable and proper. The director
            concerned must withdraw from any meeting at which
            such a proposal or the rent or other terms of the lease are
            under discussion.
            \item A director or connected person may take part in the
            normal trading and fundraising activities of the charity on
            the same terms as members of the public.
        \end{enumerate}
        
        \subsection{Payment for supply of goods only â controls}
        \item The charity and its directors may only rely upon the authority
        provided by sub-clause (2)(c) of this article if each of the
        following conditions is satisfied:
        
        \begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
            \item The amount or maximum amount of the payment for
            the goods is set out in an agreement in writing between
            the charity or its directors (as the case may be) and the
            director or connected person supplying the goods (`the
            supplier') under which the supplier is to supply the goods
            in question to or on behalf of the charity.
            \item The amount or maximum amount of the payment for
            the goods does not exceed what is reasonable in the
            circumstances for the supply of the goods in question.
            \item The other directors are satisfied that it is in the best
            interests of the charity to contract with the supplier rather
            than with someone who is not a director or connected
            person. In reaching that decision the directors must
            balance the advantage of contracting with a director or
            connected person against the disadvantages of doing so.
            \item The supplier is absent from the part of any meeting at
            which there is discussion of the proposal to enter into a
            contract or arrangement with him or her or it with regard
            to the supply of goods to the charity.
            \item The supplier does not vote on any such matter and is not
            to be counted when calculating whether a quorum of
            directors is present at the meeting.
            \item The reason for their decision is recorded by the directors
            in the minute book.
            \item A majority of the directors then in office are not in receipt
            of remuneration or payments authorised by article 7.
        \end{enumerate}
        \item In sub-clauses (2) and (3) of this article:
        \begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
            \item `charity' includes any company in which the charity:
            \begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
                \item  holds more than 50\\% of the shares; or
                \item controls more than 50\\% of the voting rights
                attached to the shares; or
                \item has the right to appoint one or more directors to the
                board of the company.
            \end{enumerate}
            \item `connected person' includes any person within the
            definition in article 61 `Interpretation'.
        \end{enumerate}
    \end{enumerate}
    
    \section{Declaration of directors' interests}
    \item A director must declare the nature and extent of any interest, direct or
    indirect, which he or she has in a proposed transaction or arrangement
    with the charity or in any transaction or arrangement entered into by
    the charity which has not previously been declared. A director must
    absent himself or herself from any discussions of the charity directors
    in which it is possible that a conflict will arise between his or her duty
    to act solely in the interests of the charity and any personal interest
    (including but not limited to any personal financial interest).
    
    \section{Conflicts of interests and conflicts of loyalties}
    \item \begin{enumerate}[label=(\arabic*)]
        \item If a conflict of interests arises for a director because of a duty of
        loyalty owed to another organisation or person and the conflict
        is not authorised by virtue of any other provision in the articles,
        the unconflicted directors may authorise such a conflict of
        interests where the following conditions apply:
        \begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
            \item the conflicted director is absent from the part of the
            meeting at which there is discussion of any arrangement
            or transaction affecting that other organisation or person;
            \item the conflicted director does not vote on any such matter
            and is not to be counted when considering whether a
            quorum of directors is present at the meeting; and
            \item the unconflicted directors consider it is in the interests
            of the charity to authorise the conflict of interests in the
            circumstances applying.
        \end{enumerate}
        \item In this article a conflict of interests arising because of a duty of
        loyalty owed to another organisation or person only refers to
        such a conflict which does not involve a direct or indirect benefit
        of any nature to a director or to a connected person
    \end{enumerate}
    
    \section{Members}
    \item \begin{enumerate}[label=(\arabic*)]
        \item The subscribers to the memorandum are the first members of
        the charity.

            refuse the application.
            \item The directors must inform the applicant in writing of
            the reasons for the refusal within twenty-one days of
            the decision.
            \item The directors must consider any written representations
            the applicant may make about the decision. The directors'
            decision following any written representations must be

        obligations attached to a class of membership.
        \item The rights attached to a class of membership may only be
        varied if:
        \begin{enumerate}[label=(\arabic*)]
            \item three-quarters of the members of that class consent in
            writing to the variation; or
            \item three-quarters of the members of that class consent in
            writing to the variation; or
        \end{enumerate}
        \item The provisions in the articles about general meetings shall apply
        to any meeting relating to the variation of the rights of any class
        of members.
    \end{enumerate}
    
    \section{Termination of membership}
    \item Membership is terminated if:

        \item the member dies or, if it is an organisation, ceases to exist;

        \begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
            \item the member has been given at least twenty-one days'
            notice in writing of the meeting of the directors at which
            the resolution will be proposed and the reasons why it is
            to be proposed;
            \item the member or, at the option of the member, the
            member's representative (who need not be a member of
            the charity) has been allowed to make representations to
            the meeting.
        \end{enumerate}
    \end{enumerate}
